# Persona-Driven Document Intelligence Approach

## Overview
This system extends the Round 1A PDF extractor to create a sophisticated persona-driven document intelligence tool. It analyzes multiple PDFs and extracts the most relevant sections based on user persona and specific job requirements.

## Technical Architecture

### Multi-Heuristic Relevance Scoring
The system uses a weighted scoring algorithm that combines:
- **Persona-specific keywords** (60% weight): Tailored vocabulary for researchers, students, analysts, and managers
- **Job-specific patterns** (40% weight): Task-oriented keywords for literature reviews, exam prep, trend analysis, etc.
- **Multilingual support**: Spanish, French, and German keyword recognition with relevance bonuses
- **Structural factors**: Section hierarchy (H1/H2/H3) and page positioning influence scores

### Persona Profiles
- **Researcher**: Focuses on methodology, results, datasets, benchmarks, and analytical content
- **Student**: Prioritizes definitions, concepts, examples, and fundamental principles
- **Analyst**: Emphasizes revenue, trends, performance metrics, and business intelligence
- **Manager**: Targets strategy, planning, decision-making, and leadership content

### Job-to-be-Done Mapping
- **Literature Review**: Extracts related work, methodologies, and comparative analyses
- **Exam Prep**: Identifies key concepts, definitions, and summary content
- **Trend Analysis**: Focuses on patterns, growth data, and temporal comparisons
- **Competitive Analysis**: Highlights market positioning and strategic comparisons

## Processing Pipeline

1. **Document Ingestion**: Processes 3-10 PDFs using the Round 1A extractor
2. **Section Extraction**: Extracts text content for each identified heading
3. **Relevance Analysis**: Applies persona and job-specific scoring algorithms
4. **Ranking & Selection**: Sorts sections by relevance and selects top candidates
5. **Text Refinement**: Cleans and optimizes text for final output

## Performance Optimizations

- **Efficient Text Processing**: Limits section text to 2000 characters to manage memory
- **Smart Caching**: Reuses PDF parsing results across analysis phases
- **Parallel-Ready Architecture**: Modular design supports future parallelization
- **Memory Management**: Proper resource cleanup and bounded text processing

## Multilingual Intelligence

The system recognizes domain-specific terms across languages:
- **Spanish**: "metodología", "resultados", "análisis"
- **French**: "méthodologie", "résultats", "analyse"  
- **German**: "methodologie", "ergebnisse", "analyse"

This ensures accurate relevance scoring for international documents while maintaining the 60-second processing constraint for 3-5 PDFs.

## Output Structure

Results include metadata (processing time, document count), ranked sections with relevance scores and explanations, and refined subsections with cleaned text content. The system provides transparency through persona/job match reasoning, enabling users to understand why specific sections were selected.
